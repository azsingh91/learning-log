      <!-- Introduction -->
      <p>This is my first website hosted on GitHub Pages!</p>
      <p>It's going to change and grow as I learn new things. There will be sections focusing on the different topics I want to become proficient in.</p>
      <p>For now, it's a work-in-progress, so it's going to look a little rough â€” but that's part of my learning journey.</p>
